      <p>
        Legendary Tuvan scholar, writer, Doctor of Historical Sciences, and shaman. He dedicated his life to preserving the ancient

        Tuvan shamanism is not a religion in the Western sense, but a way of living in harmony with
        nature. According to Kenin-Lopsan, a shaman (*Kham*) is a mediator between the human world
        and the spirits of mountains, rivers, and the sky.

        "The sound of the drum is a mystic mystery known perfectly by Tuvan shamans. For a ringing
        drum, there are no boundaries between earth and cosmos."
