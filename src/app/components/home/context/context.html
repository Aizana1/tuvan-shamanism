      <h3>The Land of Tuva</h3>
      <p>
        Located in the geographical center of Asia (Southern Siberia), Tuva is a land of steppes,
        mountains, and nomads. Isolated by the Sayan Mountains, it has preserved one of the world's
        oldest forms of shamanism in its purest form.

      <h3>The Living Tradition</h3>
      <p>
        Unlike many extinct beliefs, Tuvan shamanism is alive. It is a worldview where nature is
        animate. The Shaman (*Kham*) does not "worship" gods but negotiates with the spirits of
        fire, water, and ancestors to maintain balance in the Middle World.

      <h3>Project Mission</h3>
      <p>
        This project aims to preserve the intangible heritage of Tuva digitally. By visualizing the
        shaman's sacred tools and their meanings based on Kenin-Lopsan's ethnographic data, we open
        the closed world of the yurt to a global audience, ensuring this wisdom is not lost in time.
